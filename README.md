# Movement Tutorial

This is a quick Unity tutorial to get a GameObject to move given player input.

## Prerequisites

Before approaching this tutorial, you will need a current version of Unity and a code editor (such as Microsoft Visual Studio Community) installed and ready to use.

This tutorial was created with Unity 2022.3 LTS and Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2022 versions. It should work with earlier or later versions although you should check the release notes for other versions for changes to Editor controls and the Scripting API.

If you need help installing Unity you can many online tutorials such as:

## Objectives

In this tutorial, we will write a script that takes player input in the form of key presses or gamepad joystick movements and use it to move a Unity `GameObject` at an adjustable speed that is framerate independent.
